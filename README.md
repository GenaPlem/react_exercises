# React Exercises

This repository is a collection of various assignments and exercises I've completed while learning React. Each project showcases different features and concepts of React, from basic to advanced usage.
Initially, I tackled various assignments using separate repositories for each project. However, to streamline my workflow and to create a central hub for my learning experiences, I decided to consolidate next projects into a single repository. This makes it easier to maintain and share my progress, and I believe it provides a clearer picture of my growth as a React developer.
